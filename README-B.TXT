Last minute news flash.

The Unicode Character Database has been updated in
this directory to:

UnicodeData-2.1.2.txt

This version of the database incorporates the following
fixes authorized by the Unicode Technical Committee:

1. The decompositions of a number of compatibility characters
in the 24XX block have been marked <compat> for consistency
with other compatibility characters of the same type.

2. U+301F has been changed from Ps to Pe.

3. U+FCF2..U+FCF4 have had their decompositions changed to be
based on U+0640 TATWEEL instead of U+0020 SPACE, for consistency
with other medial Arabic compatibility characters.

diff211v212.txt provides the exact list of changes from
version 2.1.1 of the Unicode Character Database to
version 2.1.2.
