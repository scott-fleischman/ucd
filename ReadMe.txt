This directory contains the updated data files for the update release 
Unicode 3.1.1. It does not include the files that were not updated in this
version. Those must be obtained from previous update directories in
http://www.unicode.org/Public/.

This release consists of corrections and additions to the
Unicode Character Database for the Unicode Standard, 
Version 3.1.1.

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can now be found in
UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html. See also UnicodeData.html,
PropList.html, NamesList.html, and DerivedProperties.html
for specific details about particular files or sets of
files.

Unihan-3.1.1.txt is a very large file, so it is also provided in
two different compressed formats:

Unihan-3.1.1.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-3.1.1.txt.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip or gunzip)
